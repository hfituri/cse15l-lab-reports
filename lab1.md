* For the cd command it started off in the /home/lecture1/ directory. The cd command with no argumants puts you in the home directory. There was no error.
* For the ls command it was in the home directory. The ls command only gave me the lecture1 in the list of files because there are no other files in that directory. There was no error
* For the cat command it was in the home directory. The cat command returned blank lines when no arguments were passed through and there was no end to the program unless you pressed Ctrl+C. There was no error.

* For the cd command it started in the home directory. The cd command changed the directory form the home to lecture1/ when lecture1/ was passed through. There was no error.
* For the ls command it started in the /home/lecture1/ directory. The ls command returned the list in messages when messages/ directory was passed through. There was no error.
* For the cat command it started in the /home/lecture1/ directory. The cat command returned messages/ saying that it was a directory. I assume this was an eror because the cat command returns what is in a file and it did not do that in this case.

* For the cd command it started in the /home/lecture1/messages directory. The cd command did not work when a file was the input and said that it was not a directory. An error occured because a file was passed through and not a directory.
* For the ls command it started in the /home/lecture1/messages directory. The ls command printed out a list containing only the file when the file was passed as the input. There was no error.
* For the cat command it started in the /home/lecture1/messages directory. The cat command printed out the contents of the file when the file was passed through as input. There was no error.
